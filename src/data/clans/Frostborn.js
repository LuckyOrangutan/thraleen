      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>The Frostborn are one of the principal clans of the Kradonians—the resilient alien dwarves inhabiting the planet Kradon. Nestled within the treacherous Frost Peaks, the Frostborn are a democratic coalition of smaller tribes, united by their harsh environment and shared customs. Known for their exceptional adaptability and survival skills in extreme conditions, they were once famed for their mastery of the Khulghari—giant, flying marsupials native to their icy homeland. Despite technological and agricultural limitations, the Frostborn have played a crucial role in Kradonian society through their resourcefulness, unique exports, and unparalleled expertise in navigating hostile terrains.</p>
