      <h1>Adamantium Legion</h1>
      <p>The <strong>Adamantium Legion</strong> is one of the most formidable and historically significant clans of the Kradonians—an alien dwarf species renowned for their unparalleled craftsmanship on the planet Kradon. Commanding 70% of Kradon's surface before the catastrophic Unified attack, the Adamantium Legion was a vast meritocracy celebrated for its military might, architectural grandeur, and mastery over the rare and nearly indestructible metal: adamantium.</p>

    <div class="history">
      <h2>History and Rise to Power</h2>

      <h3>Discovery of Adamantium</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Early Exploration:</strong> The roots of the Adamantium Legion trace back to early Great Kradonian Tribes who settled on the planet's fertile flatlands. While surveying the land, they stumbled upon veins of a mysterious, dense metal later named adamantium.</li>
        <li><strong>Metal of Legends:</strong> Recognizing its extraordinary properties—extreme density, resilience, and near indestructibility—the clan dedicated itself to mastering the extraction and forging of adamantium.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Forging Techniques</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sun-Fire Forges:</strong> Refining adamantium was no small feat. The metal required forges of immense heat, likened to the temperature of a sun (though metaphorically). Through relentless experimentation, they developed advanced smelting techniques capable of melting and purifying adamantium ore.</li>
        <li><strong>Technological Collaboration:</strong> While the Legion prided itself on independence, they occasionally collaborated with the Thunderkin to enhance their forging processes, blending raw power with technological ingenuity.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Expansion and Meritocracy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Vast Empire:</strong> Harnessing adamantium's potential, the Legion expanded rapidly. Their empire stretched across the majority of Kradon's flatlands, a testament to their logistical prowess and scalable infrastructure.</li>
        <li><strong>Merit-Based Society:</strong> Governed by a strict meritocracy, positions of power and responsibility were earned through demonstrated ability and contribution. This system fueled innovation and maintained order within their expansive territories.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Culture and Society</h2>

      <h3>Military Excellence</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Warlike Nature:</strong> The Adamantium Legion was inherently warlike, valuing strength, strategy, and martial prowess. Their warriors were renowned for their discipline and combat skills.</li>
        <li><strong>Transformative Weaponry:</strong> Utilizing designs from the Thunderkin, they wielded transformative weapons—railguns that could seamlessly convert into plasma-edged battleaxes called Glidden Tach. The superheated edges, enabled by the unique properties of adamantium, could slice through conventional metals effortlessly without degrading the weapon.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Architectural Marvels</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Emerald Jewel Cities:</strong> The Legion's cities were architectural masterpieces. These towering structures glittered under Kradon's skies, visible from miles away and symbolizing the clan's glory.</li>

      </ul>

      <h3>Agriculture and Sustenance</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Archaic Farming Practices:</strong> Despite their technological advancements, the Legion held onto traditional farming methods, cultivating the fertile flatlands to feed their massive population.</li>
        <li><strong>Reluctance to Change:</strong> Their adherence to conventional agriculture was partly due to cultural pride and a belief in self-sufficiency, even as hydroponic systems developed by the Thunderkin proved more efficient elsewhere.</li>
