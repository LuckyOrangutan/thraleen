  overview: `
    The Deepwalkers are one of the most enigmatic and controversial clans among the Kradonians—the alien dwarf inhabitants of the planet Kradon. Known for their subterranean existence and rigid monarchy, the Deepwalkers were forced underground following early conflicts with the dominant Adamantium Legion. Their society is often characterized by brutality and strict hierarchical control, though not all members align with these extremes. Resistant to full assimilation into the unified Skyforger society, the Deepwalkers embody a complex blend of tradition, resilience, and dissent.
